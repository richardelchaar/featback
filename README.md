**Feature-Based Reddit Product Analysis Tool**

Featback is a tool designed to help product management teams efficiently gather detailed analysis and granular feedback about specific features of their products. Unlike regular sentiment analysis, which often provides only a general sentiment score, Featback dives deeper to understand the *drivers* behind user emotions. Some features may be praised while others draw criticism, and Featback helps uncover these nuances.

For example: *What do people think about the iPhone 16? What features are most commonly reviewed? What exactly about the design do they not like ‚Äî colors or weight? If they love the camera, is it about the photo quality or a zoom feature?*

Featback answers these questions by breaking down Reddit posts into **structured, feature-level insights**.

## üîé Example Breakdown

**Reddit Post**

> **Title:** ‚ÄúMixed feelings about my new iPhone 16‚Äù
>
> **Text:**
> ‚ÄúI just got the iPhone 16 and honestly I‚Äôm disappointed. The **battery barely lasts a day** and the **screen isn‚Äôt bright enough outside**. On the positive side, the **camera takes amazing photos** and the **design looks really sleek**. But I noticed some **lag when switching between apps**, which is frustrating. By the way, does anyone know if it **supports dual SIM properly in the US**?‚Äù

üëâ A **single Reddit post** becomes **two structured datasets** (reviews + questions), stored separately in S3 and Redshift for querying and visualization.

---

## üß∞ Key Technologies

* **AWS Services**

  * **S3** ‚Üí stores raw Reddit JSON and processed feedback (Parquet).
  * **Redshift** ‚Üí warehouse for efficient querying.
  * **QuickSight** ‚Üí dashboards for feature-level sentiment insights.

* **OpenAI API**

  * `gpt-4o-mini` model with prompt engineering + JSON schema enforcement.

* **Docker / Docker Compose**

  * Local demo stack (MinIO + Postgres) or full cloud mode (AWS).

* **Airflow (optional)**

  * For batch orchestration of weekly runs.

* **Python Libraries**

  * `pandas`, `pyarrow`, `boto3`, `redshift_connector`, `praw`, `pandera`, `openai`.

* **Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)**

  * Defines S3 bucket, IAM role for Redshift COPY, and other infra components.

* **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**

  * Linting, unit tests, integration tests with mocked AWS/OpenAI.
  * Terraform workflows run `init`, `validate`, and `plan`.
  * Safe for public repos (no secrets required).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Deployment

### Prerequisites

1. **AWS Credentials** (optional, for real cloud run).
2. **Redshift Access** (optional).
3. **Reddit API Credentials** (to fetch posts).
4. **OpenAI API Key** (for extraction).
5. **Docker Installed** (for local demo).
6. **QuickSight** (optional dashboards).

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` (see `.env.example`):

```env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_reddit_client_id
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_reddit_secret
REDDIT_CLIENT_AGENT=featback/1.0
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

### Local Run (Demo Mode)

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
pytest
uvicorn featback.services.api.app:app --reload
```

### Batch Run (Single Command)

```bash
python -m featback.pipeline.product_feedback iphone "Iphone 16"
```

### Terraform (IaC Validation)

```bash
cd infra/terraform
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan -var="project=featback"
```

---

## ‚úÖ Testing

* **Unit tests** (mocked S3/Reddit/LLM) ensure modules work in isolation.
* **Integration tests** run against a local MinIO + Postgres stack.
* **Pandera schemas** catch malformed data before processing.

Run all tests:

```bash
pytest
```

---

## üîÑ CI/CD

* **Lint + Tests** ‚Üí runs automatically on every PR with GitHub Actions.
* **Terraform validate/plan** ‚Üí ensures infra configs are correct.
* **Badges** (add to top of repo once Actions are live):

  * ![CI](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/<your_repo>/ci.yml?branch=main)
  * ![Terraform](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/<your_repo>/terraform.yml?branch=main)
